# 6. Fibonacci algorithm
# A Fibonacci Sequence is created by adding two numbers to create the next number in the sequence. You then sum that number with the one preceding it to get the next number,, and so on.
#
#   For example, if you have the sequence 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, then the next number in the sequence is 55.
#
#     To do this in Ruby, you can use a “while” expression to create a starting value and then tell Ruby which integers to add together.
#
#     7. Missing number game
#   For this problem, you make a function that examines an array of numbers ranging between 1 and 10 that’s missing one number and have the function find the number that’s missing.
#
#     For example, the series of numbers could be [2, 1, 5, 4, 6, 9, 7, 8, 10]. This array is missing the number 3. The goal of this problem is to write code that figures out that the number 3 is missing.
#
#     Ruby has an expression called “findmissingnumber” that you can use to examine the array you’ve written. You can instruct Ruby to compare that array to one that has the missing number, and Ruby’s internal logic can pinpoint the integer that “should” be there.
#
#     8. Reversing arrays
#   In this problem, your objective is to reverse the order of the numbers in an array. For example, if your array was [8, 2, 9, 4], you would want your code to return [4, 9, 2, 8].
#
#       To accomplish this in Ruby, your primary tool will be the “reverse” expression, which examines an array and flips the order of the values in it. You’ll also use a “while” expression and designate the position of each number to dictate which numbers to apply the “reverse” expression to.
#
#       9. Return the following number from an integer passed
#     In this problem, your goal is to create a function that uses a number as an argument, then increases it by a value of one. For example, if the number in your argument is 3, you want 4 to be returned, or if your argument number is -8, you want the number returned to be -7.
#
#       In Ruby, you’ll use the “addition” expression to do this, which adds a value to the value that’s in your argument.
#
#       10. Return the sum of two numbers
#     This challenge calls on you to write a function that adds together two numbers within an argument. For instance, if you have an argument like this: (5, 4), you want your function to add them to get their sum.
#
#       For Ruby to do this, you’ll also use the “addition” expression, which tells Ruby to add the two values within the argument.
